# NoteKeeper Web App

Welcome to the NoteKeeper web application repository! This simple web app allows users to add notes that are permanently stored, ensuring that once a note is posted, it remains in the system indefinitely. The primary purpose of this project is to test the integration of [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui) components and explore the usage of Docker for containerization.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: This web app is built using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering, making it efficient and fast for building modern web applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**: The user interface is styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a utility-first approach for designing a clean and responsive layout.

- **shadcn/ui**: The project utilizes components from [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui) for UI elements, enhancing the visual appeal and functionality of the web app.

- **Docker**: The application is containerized using Docker, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Features

- **Add Notes**: Users can easily add notes through a user-friendly interface.

- **Permanent Storage**: Once a note is posted, it is stored permanently within the system. This feature aims to explore the concept of persistent data storage.

- **Read-Only Notes**: Editing and deleting notes are intentionally disabled, emphasizing the permanent nature of the posted content.
